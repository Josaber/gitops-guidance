# GitOps (Git + Operations)

GitOps is **a set of best practices** that make Git the source of truth for everything (and not just the application source code). With GitOps you describe your whole platform (infrastructure and applications) in a declarative format and use Git for storage, history, and auditing of your deployments. Discarding custom deployment scripts and adopting a GitOps approach can help you avoid failed deployments, configuration drift, and fragile releases.

**The core idea of GitOps is having declarative descriptions of desired state of production in a Git repository like source code and an automated process to match these desired and current states of production.** It allows developers to only push commits to the repository whenever they make deployment to the production environment while automated system handles everything else.

## Core Components

### Infrastructure as Code

IaC means to define the whole infrastructure into code, not only infrastructure but also Network, Security, Configuration, and Policy.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) as the change mechanism for all infrastructure updates. The PR is where teams can collaborate via reviews and comments and where formal approvals take place. A merge commits to your main (or trunk) branch and serves as an audit log or audit trail.

### CI/CD

When new code is merged, the CI/CD pipeline enacts the change in the environment. Any configuration drift, such as manual changes or errors, is overwritten by GitOps automation so the environment converges on the desired state defined in Git.

## Flow

- developers make changes to the code
- create pull request, ci runs
- get approval and merge the pull request
- deploy automatically by cd

## Benefits

- efficiency
- security
- better developer experience
- reduced costs
- faster deployments
- organizations manage entire infrastructure and application development lifecycle
- greater collaboration and coordination between teams
- fewer errors and faster problem resolution
- ...

## How does GitOps work?

### Environment Configurations as Git repository

GitOps organizes the deployment process around code repositories as the central element. There are at least **two repositories: the application repository and the environment configuration repository**. The application repository contains the source code of the application and the deployment manifests to deploy the application. The environment configuration repository contains all deployment manifests of the currently desired infrastructure of an deployment environment. It describes what applications and infrastructural services (message broker, service mesh, monitoring tool, â€¦) should run with what configuration and version in the deployment environment.

### Push-based vs. Pull-based Deployments

There are two ways to implement the deployment strategy for GitOps: Push-based and Pull-based deployments. The difference between the two deployment types is how it is ensured, that the deployment environment actually resembles the desired infrastructure. When possible, the Pull-based approach should be preferred as it is considered the more secure and thus better practice to implement GitOps.

- Push Base Deployment: This is the traditionally used way by various tools like Jenkins, and Gitlab. Here, the pipeline executes a certain command to push the code to the environment.

- Pull Base Deployment: Here, we have an agent installed into our environment itself, which is linked to the repository itself. It keeps on checking for any change made to the repository and automatically pulls and deploys if there is any change. Tools that use the Pull Base Deployment are ArgoCD and FluxCD.
