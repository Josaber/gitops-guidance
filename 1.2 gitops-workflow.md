# GitOps Workflow

GitOps is a set of best practices that makes the development workflow simpler, more efficient, and more consistent. It describes all changes to applications and infrastructure using code checked into a source control system, and automatically synchronizes these changes with a live environment. 

The GitOps workflow is the process by which software updates and deployments occur, which differs from the traditional continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) process:

- In a traditional CI/CD workflow, developers commit new code changes to version control, the CI server runs automated tests, and if the changes look fine, pushes the changes to a container image repository. An automated deployment tool then deploys the new container to production.
- In a GitOps workflow, the CI process is exactly the same. From the deployment onwards, things work differently. When a new container image is available, a GitOps agent identifies the new container image, checks if it exists in the cluster, and if not, replaces the old version with the new.

The key difference is that while the traditional workflow is based on "pushing" new code changes through the pipeline to production, a GitOps workflow is a "pull" process in which new changes are submitted, and the GitOps agent detects them and synchronizes them with the production environment.

## Traditional Workflow vs. GitOps Workflow

The continuous integration component is at the pipeline’s start in a traditional environment. The CI component interacts with version control systems acting as a service providing the input to create operations, while the continuous deployment component acts as the service deploying the code. The pipeline uses CD automation to pass the code through an automated test suite and push the approved code to the production environment. 

**In a traditional workflow**:

1. A developer writes code and commits it to a version control system (VCS).
2. The CI server runs an automated test suite on the code.
3. If the server finds bugs or errors, the build fails and developers are notified.
4. If the server approves the code, it automatically pushes it to the container image repository.
5. An automated deployment tool pushes containers to the production environment.
6. The team manages the containers using a container orchestration tool. 

In the traditional workflow, the **CI component is at the core of this CI/CD pipeline**, but in GitOps, the VCS Git is at the center. A GitOps architecture allows developers to leverage Git as the single source of truth to manage IT infrastructure operations. Git directly manages the operations and deployments. Most developers are already familiar with Git workflows and pull requests, so it’s easy to adopt GitOps. Pull requests are review requests where the developer pushing the code to a repository requests the system to merge the code’s approval with the repository.

4. If the server approves the code, it automatically pushes it to the container image repository.

*Until this point, GitOps is identical to a traditional workflow. Now it gets interesting:*

1. A deployment automator identifies the change to the image repository and pulls it from the registry, updating the YAML file in the configuration repository. 
2. A GitOps agent identifies a change in the cluster and pulls it from the configuration repository, updating the cluster with the relevant changes. 

## GitOps Workflow in Detail

GitOps is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) evolution that leverages Git as a version control system for configuring infrastructure. IaC workflows often involve a declarative infrastructure management approach, defining a system’s desired target state and then tracking its true state.

Like IaC, GitOps requires a declarative approach to define the system’s desired state. Declarative tools allow GitOps teams to version control all of their source code and config files in Git. Typically, an external event triggers the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., a developer pushes code into the repository).

Teams can roll out new releases by making pull requests in Git, which changes the relevant cluster’s declared state. A GitOps operator between the orchestrator and the GitOps pipeline picks up new commits and pulls the new state declarations from the Git repository. Once the team approves and merges the changes, the system automatically applies them to the live infrastructure. The developers can keep using their standard CI/CD practices.

When using Kubernetes in a GitOps workflow, the operator is usually a Kubernetes Controller. This operator compares the target state in the Git repository to the deployed infrastructure’s current state. It updates the infrastructure if it detects divergence between the desired and actual state. The operator also monitors the container image repository, applying updates when the team deploys new images.

GitOps requires observability—i.e., the ability to observe the system. It allows GitOps teams to ensure that the observed actual state of an image or container matches the desired state in the repository. Using Git as the VCS and pull requests provides visibility into the deployment pipeline, allowing team members to track changes to the system, conduct audits, and apply rollbacks to breaking changes.

The GitOps workflow increases the development pipeline’s productivity and velocity while guaranteeing the system’s reliability and stability.
