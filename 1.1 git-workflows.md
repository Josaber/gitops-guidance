# Git Workflows

With Git, you can use a variety of **branching strategies** and workflows. Having a structured workflow for collaboration in complex projects is crucial for several reasons:

- **Code organization**: Keep the codebase organized, prevent overlapping work, and ensure focused efforts towards a common goal.
- **Version control**: Allow simultaneous work on different features without conflicts, maintaining code stability.
- **Code quality**: A code review and approval process helps maintain high code quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **Traceability and accountability**: Enable tracking of changes and their authors, simplifying issue identification and responsibility assignment.
- **Easier onboarding**: Help new team members quickly grasp the development process, and start contributing effectively.
- **Time and resource management**: Enable better planning, resource allocation, and meeting deadlines, ensuring an efficient development process.
- **CI/CD**: Incorporate automated testing and deployment processes, streamlining the release cycle and delivering high-quality software consistently.

A structured workflow promotes organization, efficiency, and code quality, leading to a more successful and streamlined development process.

## Workflows

- Centralized Workflow
  - Centralized version control system (SVN)
  - All team members work on a single branch, usually main, and push their changes directly to the central repository
- Github/[Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) Workflow
  - A simplified workflow primarily used for web development and continuous deployment.
  - It combines aspects of the Feature branch workflow and the Git flow workflow.
  - Developers create feature branches from main, and after the changes are complete, they are merged back into the main branch, which is then immediately deployed.
- [Feature Branching Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
  - Developers create separate branches for each feature or bugfix, keeping the ‘main’ branch stable.
  - When a feature is complete, the developer submits a merge request to integrate the changes back into main after a code review.
- [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
  - Commonly used in open-source projects, this workflow allows external contributors to work without direct access to the main repository.
  - Developers create a fork (personal copy) of the main repository and make changes in it.
  - They then submit a merge request to have those changes integrated into the main repository.
- [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
  - This workflow is best for projects with a structured release cycle.
  - It introduces two long-lived branches: main for production-ready code and develop for integrating features.
  - Additional branches like feature, release, and hotfix are used for specific purposes, ensuring a strict and organized development process.
