# ArgoCD Best Practices

## Separating Source Code and Configuration Repositories

It is best to use separate Git repositories for Kubernetes manifests and application source code. Maintaining separation between source code and config repos makes them more manageable, enabling modification of one without affecting the other. For example, developers can scale up replicas in a deployment specification without triggering a new application build. 

Another reason to keep repos separate is to maintain cleaner logs for auditing purposes. Separate repos help reduce the noise from regular development activity and make it easier to trace the Git history. It is also more secure to separate access to source code and Kubernetes manifests, given that different individuals might handle each. This separation helps restrict commit access and prevents developers from accidentally misconfiguring the application.

Microservices applications often include services that use different versioning and release cycles, so it is preferable to store the manifests in separate components. For automated CI pipelines, pushing config changes to a single Git repository may initiate a build job loop and trigger infinite Git commits.

## Selecting a Suitable Number of Deployment Configuration Repositories

It is important to consider how many repos should house an organization’s deployment configurations. Organizations have varying requirements based on their scale and complexity.

Generally, small companies that don’t rely heavily on automation, and where all employees are trusted, can use a mono-repo. Mid-sized companies that use some automation should use a repository for each team, while larger organizations that require greater control and rely significantly on automation should use repositories for each service.

Teams can often manage themselves if they have their own repository. Each team can decide who has release access, so there is no need for a central team that gives write access to each team, which may create a release bottleneck.

## Testing Manifests Before Each Commit

Software engineers often commit changes to manifests and allow the GitOps agent to try deploy the application, thus validating the changes. Testing changes before pushing them to a manifest helps prevent the introduction of issues into pre-production.

Typically, the agent uses a Helm chart or other template to generate the manifests. Engineers can run commands locally to test their manifests before they commit any changes. 

## Preventing External Changes to Manifests

Configuration drift has long been an issue for production deployments. Configuration differences between the target machines of a CI/CD deployment can cause it to fail. Developers sometimes use staging environments to test applications before deploying them to production. A staging environment should ideally have the same configuration as the production environment, ensuring that any tests reflect the real conditions of the live application. 

However, teams often change Kubernetes clusters using ad-hoc commands, not part of the CI/CD process. These changes contribute to configuration drift and impact application deployments. For example, an application might pass all the testing in the staging environment but fails when deployed to production.

Argo CD helps prevent configuration drift and maintain state traceability by using Git as a single source of truth for all current and past deployments. The Git history enables retrospective investigation. However, all manifest changes must go through Argo CD to maintain a clean history. If, for example, a developer uses `kubectl` to make changes directly, Argo CD can detect this and mark the application as OutOfSync.

Argo CD offers an auto-sync capability that, when enabled, eliminates configuration drift for Kubernetes applications. It is important to ensure that all changes to a manifest are committed to the Git repository. Kustomize and Helm support different manifests for a single commit, so developers using these should pin the dependencies to specific commits.
